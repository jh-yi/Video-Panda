> **Abstract:**
>*We present an efficient encoder-free approach for video-language understanding that achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. Current video-language models typically rely on heavyweight image encoders (300M-1.1B parameters) or video encoders (1B-1.4B parameters), creating a substantial computational burden when processing multi-frame videos. Our method introduces a novel Spatio-Temporal Alignment Block (STAB) that directly processes video inputs without requiring pre-trained encoders while using only 45M parameters for visual processing - at least a 6.5$\times$ reduction compared to traditional approaches. The STAB architecture combines Local Spatio-Temporal Encoding for fine-grained feature extraction, efficient spatial downsampling through learned attention and separate mechanisms for modeling frame-level and video-level relationships. Our model achieves comparable or superior performance to encoder-based approaches for open-ended video question answering on standard benchmarks. The fine-grained video question-answering evaluation demonstrates our model's effectiveness, outperforming the encoder-based approaches Video-ChatGPT and Video-LLaVA in key aspects like correctness and temporal understanding. Extensive ablation studies validate our architectural choices and demonstrate the effectiveness of our spatio-temporal modeling approach while achieving 3-4$\times$ faster processing speeds than previous methods.*

## 💡 Overview

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Overall Architecture" src="figs/main_arch.png" width="1200"/>
  <p align="center"><b>Detailed architecture of our Spatio-Temporal Alignment Block (STAB):</b> The input video is first converted into patches. The Local Spatio-Temporal Encoding (LSTE) uses 3D convolutions to model spatio-temporal relations and adds a 3D convolution dynamic position encoding (DPE) to encode position with respect to the local spatio-temporal window. As a result, we obtain per-frame tokens with positional encoding. The tokens are then processed in two ways. While the Global Spatio-Temporal Relationship Aggregator (GSTRA) at the top captures video-level context, the Frame-wise Spatial Relationship Aggregator (FSRA) at the bottom captures spatial context within each frame. To reduce the cost, we perform a Local Spatial Downsampling (LSD) to reduce the spatial dimension for each token. The video-level context tokens and the frame-wise spatial tokens are then linearly combined through learnable weighted fusion ($\alpha$), producing a frame-specific context token. These context tokens are then prepended to their respective frame's flattened spatial tokens, with $\texttt{<row>}$ split tokens inserted to demarcate row boundaries in the spatial layout. This combination of global context and preserved spatial structure enables effective video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>
